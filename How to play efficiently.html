		<h1>How to play efficiently</h1>
		<div>
		<p>In this game, there are certain things that must be accomplished in order to play most efficiently. The first thing that must be accomplished is the type of characters, to play efficiently throughout the entirety of the game, an account must have at least on high end driver and an ideal account will have at least two. The next thing that must be accomplished for efficiency is the type of karts and gliders, just like characters, there should be at least one high end for each. The last thing is what to play on, everybody should play on at least 150cc and in manual drift mode. PLaying on 150cc and drift mode will allow the player to achieve the maximum amount of points per race, some may say that playing on drift mode is "too hard" and that is kind of true.</p>

		<p>Drifting is essensial in this game if a player is aiming to achieve five stars on every race and to beat other players when multiplayer comes out. To use drift mode in races, the player must time their turn almost perfectly and be able to switch from drifting left, right and even forward. In order to drift, the player must slide their finger from one side of the screen to the other and to switch, the player must lift their finger off the screen and slide it in the other direction. Drifting forward is a little more complicated, the player must slide their finger to the opposite side of where there finger originally was while attempting to drift, this will cause the driver to drift either left or right, depending on what the player was attempting to do, but instead of turning, the driver drifts forward.</p>

		<p>There is more to the racing aspect in this game than just driving, after learning and mastering how to drift, there is more that you should know. Before even staring the race, the player should choose the driver that can obtain the most items per box, as this gives the player a chance to get a frenzy which will boost the points recieved by a lot. The player should also choose the kart that gives the best point multiplyer, and the glider with the best combo bonus multiplyer, if the player does this, getting points will be much easier. During the race, hold your drift for as long as possible, if the drift is longer, the colour of the sparks will change from yellow to blue and from blue to purple, this gives bonus points and a massive speed boost. Another thing to keep in mind during a race is to always keep an item behind you, for example a green shell or banana. Having an item behind you is beneficial in different ways, first is that the player always has an item ready to use just in case and the second is that it will protect you from any attacks that come from behind. The last thing to keep in mind is to do as many bonus actions as possible, use a dash panel or do a jump boost as much as you can, use a launch panel and bounce of as many objects in the air as you can. Doing all of these things ensures that the player will most definitely complete most, if not all, races with five stars.</p>
