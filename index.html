		<p>Mario Kart Tour is a mobile racing game that was recently released on IOS and Android devices that has way too many asian players that will destroy your dreams of ever wining a single race, I am one of those asians.
		It is a gacha-type game that involves obtaining different drivers, carts, and gliders by firing out of a green pipe. 
		It is a game that invloves completing different races and cups by obtaining points while racing. 
		The game will automatically place you in a match against bots/A.I as the game currently does not have multiplayer in its current stage, but promises to implement it in a future update.
		Every month, a new "tour" is added to the game. A tour is a set of races that the game gives to the players to complete within the month.</p>
