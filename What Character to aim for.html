		<p>In order to get drivers, the player must spend rubies to pull from a pipe, it costs 5 rubies for a single and 45 for 10. It is better to spend 45 rubies for 10 because you are saving 5 gems. the alternative is to spend coins to buy them from the shop. Some drivers are better than others, some drivers have better abilities and have more favoured courses. Drivers, karts and gliders all have different types, there are three types in total, Regular/normal, Super, and High End. Karts and gliders cannot actually be compared to eachother as each course has a kart or glider that is specifically meant for that course. Although, it is not the same for drivers/racers, below will be a tier list of sorts that tell you which drivers will help complete most courses with five stars. The drivers/racers will be listed in order of best to worst.</P>
