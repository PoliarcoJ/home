		<p>Although there isn't a multiplayer aspect that has been implemented into game yet, there is still a way of competing with your friends and other people around the world. There is score that you get after every race and it is made up of the points that you accumulate during the race. Every two weeks, you will get a rank and you will be able to increase your rank by getting more points in specific races for a specific cup. At the end of the month, you will be put in a tier and the higher the tier is, the better. Your rank in the weekly rankings chart will effect which tier you get placed in, as you go up in tiers, the difficulty of getting first among the people you were matched against will also rise.</p>
